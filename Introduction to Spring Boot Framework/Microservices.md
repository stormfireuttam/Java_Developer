# What are microservices?

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

    - Highly maintainable and testable
    - Loosely coupled
    - Independently deployable
    - Organized around business capabilities
    - Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

Benefits include
- Developer independence: Small teams work in parallel and can iterate faster than large teams.
- Isolation and resilience: If a component dies, you spin up another while and the rest of the application continues to function.
- Scalability: Smaller components take up fewer resources and can be scaled to meet increasing demand of that component only.
- Lifecycle automation: Individual components are easier to fit into continuous delivery pipelines and complex deployment scenarios not possible with monoliths.
- Relationship to the business: Microservice architectures are split along business domain boundaries, increasing independence and understanding across the organization.
