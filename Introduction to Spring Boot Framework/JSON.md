# What is JSON?

- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


 This example defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects):
      
      {
        "employees":[
          {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
          {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
          {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}]
      }

## JSON Syntax Rules

- Data is in name/value pairs
- Data is separated by commas
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays
