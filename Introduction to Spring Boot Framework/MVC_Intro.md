- It divides a given application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, & accepted from the user.
- The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.
- MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.
